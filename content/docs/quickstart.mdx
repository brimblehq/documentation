## Step 2: Connect Your Git Repository

Brimble integrates seamlessly with **GitHub** and **GitLab**, so you can deploy your projects directly from your repository. Here’s how to connect:

1. Navigate to your Brimble dashboard.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Select your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab).
4. Choose the repository you want to deploy.

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: If your repository is private, make sure to grant Brimble the necessary permissions during the connection process.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Configure Your Deployment

Once your repository is connected, Brimble will automatically detect your project type and suggest a configuration. Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Select a Framework**: Brimble supports popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue.js, Nuxt, Astro, and more. If your framework isn’t listed, choose **Static Site** or **Custom**.
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Add any environment variables your project needs (e.g., API keys, secrets).
3. **Choose a Branch**: Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`, `develop`).

<Callout type="warning">
  **Heads Up**: If your project requires a custom build command or output directory, you can configure these settings in the **Advanced Options**.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Deploy Your Project

Once everything is configured, click **Deploy**. Brimble will:
1. Build your project.
2. Optimize it for production.
3. Deploy it to a global CDN.

You’ll get a **live URL** where your project is hosted. Share it with your team or the world!
