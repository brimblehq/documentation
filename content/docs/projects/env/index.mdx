### Best Practices

- **Centralize Common Values:** Use shared variables for configurations like API endpoints, ensuring consistency across projects.  
- **Review Permissions:** Limit access to sensitive variables to only those who need it.  
- **Test Before Deployment:** Verify variable values in staging environments to avoid misconfigurations.

By using shared Environment Variables, you streamline your project management and ensure consistent, secure configurations across environments.
