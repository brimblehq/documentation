description: "Learn about the architecture of Brimble's portable deployment system."
---

The Brimble CLI tool facilitates setting up Brimble on your own servers, leveraging a robust microservices architecture. This design prioritizes scalability, security, and maintainability, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes. Below, we outline the architecture's components, design principles, and data flow.

## Core Components

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Load Balancer**         | Entry point for client requests, distributing traffic efficiently.              |
| **Tailscale VPN Gateway** | Provides secure, private network connections across servers.                    |
| **Brimble Runners**       | Distributed task execution nodes outside the main datacenter.                   |
| **Nomad Cluster**         | Handles container orchestration with a leader-follower configuration.           |
| **Consul Service Mesh**   | Manages service discovery, health checks, and configuration.                    |
| **Backend Services**      | TCP/UDP services distributed across Nomad nodes for high availability.          |

## Key Features

<Callout>
The architecture is designed to balance performance, scalability, and security while ensuring high availability.
</Callout>

1. **Scalability**  
   Horizontal scaling ensures seamless handling of increased workloads.
   
2. **Security**  
   Isolated network segments and a VPN gateway protect sensitive data.
   
3. **High Availability**  
   Distributed nodes and a leader-follower Nomad cluster configuration reduce downtime.

4. **Service Discovery**  
   Dynamic service registration and discovery are managed via Consul.

5. **Observability**  
   Integrated metrics and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) ensure comprehensive system insights.

---

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**
   - All client requests begin at the **Load Balancer**.

2. **VPN Gateway**
   - Requests are routed through the **Tailscale VPN Gateway** for secure access.

3. **Distributed Execution**
   - The gateway distributes traffic to either:
     - **Brimble Runners** for task execution.
     - Datacenter services managed by the **Nomad Cluster**.

4. **Backend Communication**
   - Backend services within the datacenter communicate over a secure mesh provided by **Consul**.

## Deployment Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Install CLI**: Use the Brimble CLI to initialize the setup.
2. **Generate License**: Obtain and validate the license key.
3. **Provision Servers**: Configure servers with the recommended specifications.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Deploy required tools and configurations:
   - Nomad
   - Consul
   - Docker
   - Node.js
5. **Configure Metrics and Monitoring**:
   - Install `node-exporter`, `cAdvisor`, and `Grafana-Promtail`.
   - Attach Loki to deployment containers for centralized logging.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection (private IP).
- Set up Grafana for dashboards and monitoring (public IP).

## Script Installation Process
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Tabs items={["Script Installation", "Configuration File"]}>

```bash tab="Script Installation"
# Step 1: Download the setup script
curl -O https://cdn.brimble.io/setup.sh

# Step 2: Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Step 3: Run the script with the 'runner' flag to install the Brimble runner
./setup.sh --runner

# Additional flags can be used for custom configurations:
# ./setup.sh --runner --custom-flag=value
// Example Configuration File for CLI
