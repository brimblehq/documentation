### Find a Domain

Start by finding the perfect domain that represents your brand or identity. Visit Brimble's domain search tool at [beta.brimble.io/domains/new](https://beta.brimble.io/domains/new) and search for an available domain, such as "Sealord."

Prices vary based on the TLD (e.g., .com, .io), so explore different options to find the ideal match for your needs.

This step ensures you’re securing the domain for the duration that best fits your plans.
