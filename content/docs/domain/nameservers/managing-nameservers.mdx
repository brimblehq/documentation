description: 'Learn how to add custom nameservers and restore original nameservers for your domains on Brimble 
with this guide.'
---

Nameservers are essential for resolving domain names to IP addresses. For domains registered with Brimble, you 
can view, edit, and reset nameservers by selecting the domain from the Domains tab on your Account Settings 
page (for account-scoped domains) or your team's dashboard.

Sometimes, you may need to delegate nameserver management to another host. Brimble allows you to add custom 
nameservers directly from the dashboard, enabling delegation to other DNS providers. You can add up to four 
nameservers at a time and revert to your previous settings if necessary.

For domains not registered with Brimble, you can change the nameservers through your domain registrar's 
dashboard.

Keep in mind that nameserver changes can take up to 48 hours to complete due to DNS propagation.

## Add custom nameservers

3. In the Edit Nameservers modal, add the new nameservers:
